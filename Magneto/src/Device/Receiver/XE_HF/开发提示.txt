1.为什么要用Telnet？
The WBAT CSCI is not launched automatically on MRE unit power-up. Before opening the command link, it is necessary to
check the physical link and launch the software. To do this, the following operations have to be carried out: 
• Check that the MRE unit is present, powered up and with the Linux system active by opening a client IP link at the unit
address (22.250.11.2 by default) on port 26 for a XE unit or 27 for a TRC6200 unit. If the connection is accepted, the unit 
is ready for WBAT software launching. The link must then be closed. 
• Launch the WBAT software via the following TelNet command: « telnet 22.250.11.2 26 » (port 26 for a unit of XE type or
27 for a unit of TRC6200 type). The WBAT software remains active as long as the TelNet process is open. 
• Wait 1 s until the WBAT software is initialized. 
• Open a client TCP/IP link on port 49000 for the transmission and reception of commands. 
• Message 0x80 (Interface Version) is sent automatically by the WBAT software on connection of a client. 
• On closing the command link, close the TelNet process to terminate the WBAT software.

3.命令端口
The exchanges of command messages are achieved via the TCP/IP protocol according to the BIG ENDIAN 
convention on port 49 000 (configurable via the XML file) : 
Server : LINUX PC Extraction. The link is established at start-up and closed on quitting the application.
